## Description

Dropshipping is an order fulfillment option that allows ecommerce businesses to outsource the processes of procuring, storing, and shipping products to a third party—typically a supplier.

As the coffee shop market becomes more popular, the number of cafe websites is growing.

Typically the dropshipping process follows this general sequence:

1. Customer need to log in/create account and order online.
2. Customer create an order
3. Customer must fill in the delivery information and confirm the payment.
4. We forwards the order to dropshipper and manipulate the product database.
5. Customer receives their product.
